- Use Tag Helpers instead of HTML Helpers
- Use the View Component Tag Helper
- Use the Page Builder Mode Tag Helper for better Content Management UX

## Rendering

### Use Tag Helpers intead of HTML Helpers

<Recommend />

- Update the `_ViewImports.cshtml` with `@addTagHelper` directives [to enable Xperience's Tag Helpers](https://docs.xperience.io/x/RofWCQ)
- Only use Xperience's Tag Helpers in Razor Views
- Avoid using [HTML Helpers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/older-versions-1/views/creating-custom-html-helpers-cs)

**Why?**

Xperience by Kentico has kept `HtmlHelper` methods and extensions to make the upgrade from Kentico 12 MVC and Kentico Xperience 13 easier for teams.
However, they are part of ASP.NET Core's legacy from MVC 5.
[Tag Helpers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/tag-helpers/intro?view=aspnetcore-7.0) were designed to replace Html Helpers.

**Why?**

Front-end developers who are more familiar with HTML than Razor and C# will have a harder time using and reading HTML Helpers than Tag Helpers
because Tag Helpers look like and often behave like native HTML.
By using Tag Helpers, we can make our projects more accessible and welcoming to developers new to ASP.NET Core.

**Why?**

Tag Helpers are much more common in ASP.NET Core projects than HTML Helpers and the built-in ASP.NET Core Tag Helpers
are frequently used. We should align with the conventions of modern ASP.NET Core where Xperience enables us.

## Sections

### Avoid the Built-In Default Section

<Suggest />

- Create a new [Page Builder Section](https://docs.xperience.io/x/9AWiCQ) that uses your site's design
- Assign it as a custom [default Section](https://docs.xperience.io/xp/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder/sections-for-page-builder#SectionsforPageBuilder-Assignadefaultsection) for the application
- Use `<editable-area />` `allowed-sections` [restrictions](https://docs.xperience.io/xp/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder/create-pages-with-editable-areas#Createpageswitheditableareas-Configureallowedcomponentsforeditableareas) to exclude Xperience's Default Section from being used

**Why?**

The Page Builder is where structured content is composed with presentational experiences and design.
A marketer's Page Builder experience should be tailored to their site's content and design requirements.

**Why?**

Xperience's included Default Section is great for enabling developers to get started quickly but it wasn't designed
for _our_ site's needs.

**Why?**

We should be using the `allowed-widgets` and `allowed-sections` restrictions of each `<editable-area />` anyway.

:::note

If we want to use the built-in Default Section, we can still customize its design (but not functionality)
by creating a custom View at the following location in our project: `~/Views/Shared/Kentico/PageBuilder/_DefaultSection.cshtml`

This will override the rendering of the built-in Default Section.
