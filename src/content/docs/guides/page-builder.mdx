- Use the Page Builder Mode Tag Helper for better Content Management UX

## Routing

### Default to using Page Templates (+ View Components)

<Recommend />

- Use Page Templates as the default rendering approach for [Content Tree Routing](https://docs.xperience.io/x/GoXWCQ)

:::caution
If you use Page Templates for a Page Type, and don't have a fallback Razor View for [Basic Routing](https://docs.xperience.io/x/HoXWCQ),
then any Pages of this Page Type defined through the API will need to have their `DocumentPageTemplateConfiguration` field manually set with a valid value.

You can resolve this by assigning a Page Template to a Page programmatically when it's created:

```csharp
var page = new HomePage();

string config = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(
  new { identifier = "Sandbox.HomePage" },
  new JsonSerializerSettings
  {
      ContractResolver = new CamelCasePropertyNamesContractResolver(),
      Formatting = Formatting.None,
  });

_ = page.SetValue("DocumentPageTemplateConfiguration", config);
```

## Razor

### Keep View Injected Dependencies Minimal

<Recommend />

### Break up Layout Into Smaller View Components

### View Components vs Partial Views

<Recommend />

- Leverage View Components over Partial Views
  - Better type checking, intellisense

### Use Tag Helpers intead of HTML Helpers

<Recommend />

- Update the `_ViewImports.cshtml` with `@addTagHelper` directives [to enable Xperience's Tag Helpers](https://docs.xperience.io/x/RofWCQ)
- Only use Xperience's Tag Helpers in Razor Views
- Avoid using [HTML Helpers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/older-versions-1/views/creating-custom-html-helpers-cs)

**Why?**

Xperience by Kentico has kept `HtmlHelper` methods and extensions to make the upgrade from Kentico 12 MVC and Kentico Xperience 13 easier for teams.
However, they are part of ASP.NET Core's legacy from MVC 5.
[Tag Helpers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/tag-helpers/intro?view=aspnetcore-7.0) were designed to replace Html Helpers.

**Why?**

Front-end developers who are more familiar with HTML than Razor and C# will have a harder time using and reading HTML Helpers than Tag Helpers
because Tag Helpers look like and often behave like native HTML.
By using Tag Helpers, we can make our projects more accessible and welcoming to developers new to ASP.NET Core.

**Why?**

Tag Helpers are much more common in ASP.NET Core projects than HTML Helpers and the built-in ASP.NET Core Tag Helpers
are frequently used. We should align with the conventions of modern ASP.NET Core where Xperience enables us.

## Components

### Avoid the Built-In Default Section

<Suggest />

- Create a new [Page Builder Section](https://docs.xperience.io/x/9AWiCQ) that uses your site's design
- Assign it as a custom [default Section](https://docs.xperience.io/xp/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder/sections-for-page-builder#SectionsforPageBuilder-Assignadefaultsection) for the application
- Use `<editable-area />` `allowed-sections` [restrictions](https://docs.xperience.io/xp/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder/create-pages-with-editable-areas#Createpageswitheditableareas-Configureallowedcomponentsforeditableareas) to exclude Xperience's Default Section from being used

**Why?**

The Page Builder is where structured content is composed with presentational experiences and design.
A marketer's Page Builder experience should be tailored to their site's content and design requirements.

**Why?**

Xperience's included Default Section is great for enabling developers to get started quickly but it wasn't designed
for _our_ site's needs.

**Why?**

We should be using the `allowed-widgets` and `allowed-sections` restrictions of each `<editable-area />` anyway.

:::note

If we want to use the built-in Default Section, we can still customize its design (but not functionality)
by creating a custom View at the following location in our project: `~/Views/Shared/Kentico/PageBuilder/_DefaultSection.cshtml`

This will override the rendering of the built-in Default Section.

:::

### Co-locate Page Builder registration, types, and values

<Recommend />

- Define Page Template, Widget, and Section Identifiers close to their registration attributes
- Define component Properties and View Model classes close to the components that use them
- Define component registration attributes near where they are defined

**Why?**

Things that change together should stay together. A component should only be removed if its identifier is also removed.
Keeping these two things close together helps ensure this consistency.

**Why?**

Navigation to the definition of a component identifier - if it's referenced through a variable -
should bring a developer close to the definition of the associated component.

**Why?**

As [Joel Spolsky stated](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/05/11/making-wrong-code-look-wrong/),
"the more information about what code is doing is located right in front of your eyes, the better a job you'll do at finding the mistakes".

:::danger[Don't]
Don't put all component identifiers for your application in a single class.
:::

```csharp
public static class ComponentIdentifiers
{
    // Sections
    public const string SINGLE_COLUMN_SECTION = "KBank.SingleColumnSection";
    public const string FORM_COLUMN_SECTION = "KBank.FormColumnSection";

}
```

:::danger[Don't]
Don't create separate files for component View Component, View Model and Properties classes
and store them in various places in your project folders.
:::

```csharp
// ~/Components/Widgets/Heading/HeadingWidget.cs
public class HeadingWidget : ViewComponent
{
    // ...
}

// ~/Components/Widgets/Heading/HeadingWidgetProperties.cs
public class HeadingWidgetProperties : IWidgetProperties
{
    //...
}

// ~/Components/Widgets/Heading/HeadingWidgetViewModel.cs
public class HeadingWidgetViewModel
{
    //...
}
```

:::tip[Do]
Define components identifiers near their component and co-locate all related classes
:::

```csharp
// ~/Components/Widgets/Heading/HeadingWideget.cs
using Sandbox.Components.Sections.Heading;
using Kentico.PageBuilder.Web.Mvc;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

[assembly: RegisterSection(
    identifier: HeadingSection.IDENTIFIER,
    viewComponentType: typeof(HeadingSection),
    name: "Heading",
    propertiesType: typeof(HeadingSectionProperties),
    Description = "Heading Section to be used at the top of a page",
    IconClass = "icon-i"
)]

namespace Sandbox.Components.Sections.Heading;

public class HeadingSection : ViewComponent
{
    public const string IDENTIFIER = "Sandbox.Sections.Heading";

    public IViewComponentResult Invoke(ComponentViewModel<HeadingSectionProperties> vm)
    {
        var model = new HeadingSectionViewModel { };

        View("~/Components/Sections/Heading/HeadingSection.cshtml", model);
    }
}

public class HeadingSectionProperties : ISectionProperties { }

public class HeadingSectionViewModel { }
```

### Access Component Identifiers through an Abstraction

<Suggest />

- Create a static abstraction to access component identifiers if their use is statically defined (typical)
- Create an injectable service abstraction to access component identifiers if their use is dynamically defined (advnaced)

**Why?**

As mentioned above, component identifiers should be defined near the component definition, but accessing them
for `<editable-area>` and `<widget-zone>` Tag Helpers should be convenient.

**Why?**

An abstraction can give developers easier discoverability of the components available in a solution.

**Why?**

If needed, the abstraction can be registered as a scoped service in the ASP.NET Core DI container
and injected into the view.

:::tip[Do]
Create a simple abstraction to organize identifiers and include a static alias in the `_ViewImports.cshtml`
for easy access.
:::

````csharp
// ~/Components/Widgets/WidgetIdentifiers.cs
namespace Sandbox.Components.Widgets;

public static class WidgetIdentifiers
{
    public static class Accordions
    {
        public const string Accordion = AccordionWidget.IDENTIFER;
    }

    public static class Badges
    {
        public const string BadgesList = BadgesListWidget.IDENTIFIER;
    }

    public static class CTAs
    {
        public const string CTALink = CTALinkWidget.IDENTIFIER;
        public const string CTAClinicalTrialLink = CTAClinicalTrialLinkWidget.IDENTIFIER;
    }

    public static class Forms
    {
        public const string Form = SystemComponentIdentifiers.FORM_WIDGET_IDENTIFIER;
        public const string CTAForm = CTAFormWidget.IDENTIFIER;
        public const string InlineForm = InlineFormWidget.IDENTIFIER;
    }

    // ...
}

```csharp

````

```

```
