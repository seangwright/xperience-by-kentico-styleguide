## Razor

### Use the View Component Tag Helper

<Recommend />

- Use the [View Component Tag Helper](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/view-components?view=aspnetcore-7.0#invoke-a-view-component-as-a-tag-helper-1) (`<vc:>`)
  in Razor Views

**Why?**

Tag Helpers help to add behavior to HTML rendering with Razor, but use an HTML-like syntax
instead of C#, which can be easier to read, especially for developers not as familiar with C#.

It's recommended to use the Xperience by Kentico Page Builder Tag Helpers, so following the convention
for non-Xperience View Components follows this convention.

**Why?**

The View Component Tag Helper will provide syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and parameter hints in most editors.

Invoking a View Component with C# [provides no type safety](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/view-components?view=aspnetcore-7.0#invoke-a-view-component-1)
for the component or its parameters, so it is almost always a worse developer experience than the View Component Tag Helper.

:::danger[Don't]
Don't use the `@await Component.InvokeAsync()` C# method to render View Components
:::

:::tip[Do]
Use the `<vc:your-component />` Tag Helper to render View Components

### Move Razor configuration to the application root

<Recommend />

- Move the `~/Views/_ViewImports.cshtml` file to the `~/` application root.
- Move the `~/Views/_ViewImports.cshtml` file to the `~/` application root.

**Why?**

If we follow a Feature Folder based approach to project organization we will end up with Views, Templates, and Components
outside the ASP.NET Core `~/Views` folder, which would prevent the `_ViewImports.cshtml` and `_ViewStart.cshtml` files
from being applied for Views outside of the `~/View` folder.

**Why?**

The default ASP.NET Core template places the `_ViewImports.cshtml` and `_ViewStart.cshtml`
files are stored in the `~/Views` folder, which is helpful when you have
[ASP.NET Core Areas](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/areas) in your app.

Xperience by Kentico does not support Areas,
so the [\_ViewImports.cshtml](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/areas?view=aspnetcore-6.0#_viewimportscshtml)
and [\_ViewStart.cshtml](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/areas?view=aspnetcore-6.0#shared-layout-for-areas-using-the-_viewstartcshtml-file) files
application root to ensure they are shared across the entire project's Razor Views.

This is a valid location for these files in ASP.NET Core projects and is a better
default for Xperience by Kentico projects heavy reliance on Razor template rendering.

### Name View files by their Page or Component

<Suggest />

- Name your Razor View files to match the page or component they are used with
- Drop the suffix from the `.cshtml` file name

**Why?**

Finding files through editor quick search (ex: ctrl+p or cmd+p in VS Code) often
works by file name matching. Having dozens of files all named `Default.cshtml`
for View Components can make it difficult to select the right one.

A similar problem occurs when the file is open in an editor as a tab - the file
name is too generic to be helpful.

**Why**

View Component, Page Template, and MVC View files should be organized by feature folder
next to their component. This naming convention will alphabetically group the files in your editor.

:::tip[Do]
Name View files to match their use case.
