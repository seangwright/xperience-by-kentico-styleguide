## Documentation

### Use a repository `README.md`

<Recommend />

- Add a `README.md` to the root of your repository
- Write a brief description of the project
- Detail steps to get the project running for local development
- Explain the process for contributing to

**Why?**

New developers on the project will reference a `README.md` to orient themselves in the project.
Setup instructions will help them troubleshoot working on the application.

**Why?**

Having project information in a `README.md` that exists in the project's repository (co-located)
increases the likelihood of the information being kept up to date as the project changes.

### Enhance the `README.md`

<Suggest />

- Create a table that lists the details of Web and Database Server details for each environment
- List project features and integrations
- Link to other project documentation
  - [Maintain Architectural Decision Records (ADR)](#maintain-architectural-decision-records-adr)
  - [Commit SQL scripts](#commit-sql-scripts)
- Include a [Mermaid.js](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid) diagram of the project architecture

**Why?**

Environment information (URLs, Server Names) is often implicit knowledge on a team. Detailing this in the project `README.md` makes it discoverable and maintainable, reducing information silos.

**Why?**

A list of features and integrations is a good high level substitute for package and infrastructure dependencies in an application. This list often shows what the volatile dependencies and complex areas of an application are.

### Maintain Architectural Decision Records (ADR)

<Suggest />

- Create an `ADR.md` file in the root of your project's repository
- Add a dated entry as a record of each significant architecture addition or change
- Include the entry as part of a code review process

**Why?**

Business rule and project requirement changes are often recorded by project management or stakeholders, but the impact that these changes have on an application can easily be forgotten. An `ADR` file encourages recording a history of changes that developers can consult in the future to better understand decisions made in the past.

**Why?**

An ADR entry should include details about an architectural decision. If there were multiple solutions available, the entry should describe each one, including their pros/cons, and why the chosen solution was selected. Writing out this decision making process can help reflect on the _why_ of a change and expressing explicitly any implications of the solution.

:::tip[What is an Architectural Decision Record?]
An Architectural Decision (AD) is a software design choice that addresses a functional or non-functional requirement that is architecturally significant.

---

An Architecture Decision Record is a tool for documenting a decision that has been made (or is under discussion) related to the architecture of a particular system or application.

## Organization

### Use Feature Folders (Vertical Slice Architecture)

<Recommend />

- Create folders in a .NET and Node.js projects based on a feature
- Organize and architect classes to be feature-oriented

**Why?**

Developers work on features so organizing code by feature helps developers find many of
the pieces of code they need to modify when working on a feature. If they need to create new code for a feature,
it's obvious, based on the feature-oriented organization, where that code should go in a project.

**Why?**

Projects organized by features are more comprehensible because the feature folders end up being
a list of the application's main entry points an functionality. The feature folders also aid in revealing
the complexity level of a given feature compared to another.

**Why?**

Feature folders encourage developers to think about functionality as a [Vertical Slice](https://codeopinion.com/restructuring-to-a-vertical-slice-architecture/),
which is an architecture that leads to features that are easier to work on without incurring regressions elsewhere in an application. Vertical slices are also
easier to separate into their own applications if they end up having unique scalability or deployment requirements.

:::danger[Avoid organizing by type]
Developers are never tasked to work on "interfaces" or "view models". Instead they are tasked with
resolving issues or creating new functionality for features. Organizing code by what 'type' of a thing
it is (ex: "interface", "implementation", "factory", "view model") focuses too much on a somewhat arbitrary
technical detail, while the real focus in a codebase should be on business use-case.

## Visual Studio Solution

### Create Solution Items folder

<Recommend />

- Add a new [folder in your .NET solution](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/solutions-and-projects-in-visual-studio?view=vs-2022#solution-folder)
  to contain items at the root of your project that should be visible in Visual Studio
- It's common to name this folder `Solution Items`

**Why?**

.NET solutions have traditionally focused on source code and projects since they are a target for compilation. However,
it's also common to have many files in a .NET repository that are not code or projects, like [README.md](#add-a-repository-readme-md) and `.gitignore` files.
These should be viewable and editable in the same way that source code is editable. Having these files visible (in Visual Studio or Rider)
makes them more likely to be edited and kept up to date.

**Why?**

Having a solution folder with a convention-based name makes it easier for developers to explore a project and find common non-code files.

:::tip
These items are normally visible in other IDEs (like VS Code), so this is mostly relevant for developers using Visual studio
:::

### Co-Locate source code and test code

<Suggest />

- In a .NET solution, keep test projects adjacent to the applications and libraries they are associated with
- Create a solution folder for each project and place both the application (or library) and its test project in the solution folder

**Why?**

By co-locating tests and the source the tests were written for, the tests and code are more likely to stay in-sync.

**Why?**

Developers will be more likely to keep testing in mind when adding new features if they are reminded there is a place to add
tests in the solution and they don't have to go hunt down the correct test project.

**Why?**

Solution folders are a virtual organizational tool for .NET projects. This means source code and test code can still
be located in different paths on the file system (ex: `src/` and `test/`) even if they are co-located in the solution.
